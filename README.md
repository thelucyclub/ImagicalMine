## new repo who dis?

Multiplayer is being overrun with a multitude of commercial projects, and it's completely changing the dynamics of our community. I'm constantly seeing people complaining about the inactivity of PocketMine-MP, but have yet to see anybody make any effort to remedy the situation. 

### Here is why I dislike ImagicalMine:

- [x] ImagicalMine completely disregards the progress that PocketMine-MP has made, and repackages it's code as their own.
- [x] ImagicalMine doesn't offer anything custom. All of their contributions are copied directly off the Genisys branch.
- [x] ImagicalMine doesn't allow PocketMine servers to be listed on their website in an effort to make a blatant barrier.
- [x] Keith has no coding knowledge whatsoever. He literally just whines to his developers in the issue tracker until somebody finds some Genisys code to copy & paste.
- [x] ImagicalMine strays so far away from the official branch that compatibility issues happen way too often for comfort. They made a promise to improve upon PocketMine not completely change it.
